## My Introduction
I completed my_ O Levels _from **The City School** and pursued my _A Levels _at **Nixor College**. Alongside my academic journey, I’ve always had a strong passion for _football_. I not only played actively but also had the privilege of leading my team as captain, which helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and communication skills both on and off the field.In addition to_ academics and sports_, I’ve developed a strong interest in programming. I enjoy solving problems through code and exploring how technology can be used to build practical solutions. Learning new languages and working on small projects has helped me strengthen my logical thinking and creativity.
