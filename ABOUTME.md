My name is Muhammad Umer, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. Outside of academics, football has always been a major passion of mine. As a dedicated player and team captain, the sport has taught me valuable lessons in leadership, discipline, and teamwork. It continues to be a key part of my life, helping me stay focused and balanced alongside my studies.
